# [Cloud CDN](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/)

Cloud CDN is currently only used in service of [assets](/docs/systems/assets.md). Original user assets are served from a [storage](/docs/services/gcp/storage.md) bucket backend and resized images are served from a [thumbor](/docs/services/backend/thumbor.md) service backend.

TODO: talk about signing keys, urls as temporary authority, teraform resources, maybe elaborate on what's encoded in the tf resources?
