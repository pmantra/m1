# This is a list of all files that are expected to exist within the build
# context but not in the built image. These files are not copied to the image
# because they match patterns found in the .dockerignore file located within the
# supplied context. 
# 
# If you arrived here because this script produced an error on your MR, you will
# need to review the output and likely update the .dockerignore file to reflect
# the outcome you desire. 
#
# Recommendations:
# 1. If you are adding a new python package, it is likely ignored by default.
#    Add your package path to the .dockerignore file following the same pattern
#    as the other packages. In this case you do not need to make a change in the
#    list below.
# 2. If you have added any auxiliary file that is not expected to appear in the
#    production runtime image, you must add a regex pattern to the list below
#    that matches your file(s). You must be certain that your file could never
#    be accessed during runtime before adding to this list. There are multiple
#    runtime paths that import pytest files (especially in the admin images) so
#    it cannot be assumed that all files in the */pytests/* directory are safe
#    to ignore. Until a tool is provided to ascertain that dependency information
#    for you, you can leverage `dep-tree` starting at the application roots and
#    grep for your files. Note this is also not perfect because there are
#    runtime imports littered about... These are not reachable by `dep-tree` and
#    likely must be discovered by "letting Jesus take the wheel".... godspeed...

#
# Below is the list of regex patterns that are allowed to not appear in the
# built image.
#   - Please keep in alphabetical order
#   - Each line shoud have the format `^.....$|\` where .... is the regex pattern
#     to your file(s).
#   - Please keep in alphabetical order
