	<p class="edu-only-warn lg">You <strong>can't get a prescription</strong> in an education-only appointment.</p>
	<p>Education-only appointments give you a larger number of practitioners to choose from and are great at getting general answers to questions. The practitioner won't see your name or any other information about you – perfect for any embarassing questions!</p>
