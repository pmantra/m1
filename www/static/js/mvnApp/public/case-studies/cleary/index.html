			As one of the nation’s preeminent law firms, Cleary is committed to offering employees an industry-leading
			benefits package, and was looking for a program to support expectant and new parents beyond their existing paid
			leave policy and child care options. Further, offering fertility and egg freezing benefits was important to Cleary
			to make sure employees had all options available relating to family planning. But any new benefit had to be easy
			to implement. And, because Cleary’s lawyers and professional staff are dedicated to responding to the needs of
			their prestigious clients, they required a user-friendly solution that was not limited to regular business hours.

			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<p>
				Maven differentiated itself from competitors in a number of key areas, making the end decision a “no-brainer”
				according to Danielle.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid-container two-column">
			<div class="callout grid-item bg-cool">
				<h3>
					“With Maven, you have actual maternal and family health specialists who are answering your questions. When
					you're breastfeeding, you want an actual, certified lactation consultant. You don't want somebody who was just
					trained on something a month ago.”
				</h3>
				<h5>Danielle Caloia</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="grid-item self-centered">
				<p>
					First, the benefits themselves. Unlike any other solution, Maven is a one-stop-shop that covers everything a
					busy professional might need when they start a family, including IVF support, partner support, adoption,
					surrogacy, and pregnancy. Maven’s 15-month maternity program was standout, focusing on the entire maternity,
					postpartum, and return-to-work experience. Its unrivaled network of over 1,200 highly vetted health providers,
					including specialists like lactation consultants, career coaches, and sleep coaches, has a practitioner for
					every user.
				</p>
				<p>
					Maven is also a perfect fit for Cleary’s busy employees. Its innovative mobile app allows for on-demand access
					to its practitioner network, extensive resource library, and a personal “concierge” or care advocate, who
					serves as a guide and contact throughout the fertility and maternity journey.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, HR appreciated what Lauren called “the most seamless and simple implementation process that I’ve
					ever encountered.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Internal buy-in came with remarkable ease. After seeing all Maven had to offer, a senior executive commented,
					“I wish I had this when I had my son.”

			<h3>Results</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="grid-container two-column">
			<div class="grid-item self-centered">
				<p>
					In just six months, Cleary has received overwhelmingly positive feedback and significant Maven utilization
					without incentive—74% percent of pregnant employees are participating and have found Maven via the company
					intranet or through direct emails from Cleary’s HR team. Maven anticipates 95% participation in Year 1.
				</p>

				<p>
					Danielle says “this was one of the first benefits to garner such an outpouring of praise, even from employees
					who were never planning on using it. The impact has been huge.”
				</p>

				<p>
					After rolling out the maternity program, adding Maven’s fertility program a few months later was an “obvious”
					next step, according to Danielle. Egg freezing is now covered, as are treatments for LGBT employees seeking to
					become parents.
				</p>

				<p>
					Danielle says, “Our instinct was that family benefits would have universal appeal, even if they were only used
					by a subset of employees. The positive response and goodwill generated has exceeded anything we’d imagined.”

		Lauren has found that, “first-class family benefits are essential for attracting and retaining top talent. These
		benefits are imperative for our diverse community of employees. And with their regular reporting, Maven makes it
		easy to measure impact and engagement, and we know we are getting real value.”
