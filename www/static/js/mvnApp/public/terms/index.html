				with its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, and assigns, &ldquo;Maven&rdquo;, &ldquo;we,&rdquo; or
				&ldquo;us&rdquo;). Please read these terms of use (&ldquo;Terms of Use&rdquo;) carefully because they set forth
				the important terms you will need to know about the Service. In these Terms of Use, the terms &ldquo;you&rdquo;
				and &ldquo;yours&rdquo; refer to the person using the Service. Use of the Service is governed by these Terms of
				Use, and by using the Service you agree to abide by these Terms of Use as well as all applicable laws and

				Terms of Use. Your access to and use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to abide by
				each of these terms and conditions set forth below. If you do not agree with these Terms of Use, do not use the
				Service.

				then you are an “Enterprise User.” We will identify below where specific terms apply to you differently as an
				Enterprise User.
			</p>

			<strong>IF YOU HAVE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, IMMEDIATELY CALL YOUR DOCTOR OR DIAL 911. </strong>

			<p>
				THE SERVICE PROVIDES GENERAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS INFORMATION AND A MEANS TO INTERACT WITH PRACTITIONERS. IT DOES
				NOT REPLACE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY PRACTITIONER OR SERVICE, AND MAVEN, ITSELF, DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL OR
				HEALTH ADVICE, CARE, DIAGNOSIS, OR TREATMENT. NONE OF THE CONTENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MEDICAL ADVICE OR AN
				ENDORSEMENT, REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY THAT ANY PARTICULAR MEDICATION OR TREATMENT IS SAFE, APPROPRIATE, OR
				EFFECTIVE FOR YOU.
			</p>

			<h5>PRIVACY</h5>

			By using the Service, you consent to our processing your information consistent with our Privacy Policy at
			<a href="http://www.mavenclinic.com/privacy-policy">www.mavenclinic.com/privacy-policy</a>. Please review the

			<h5>SERVICE DESCRIPTION</h5>

			<p>
				The Service provides individuals accessing it with general information on health care and other general content
				&nbsp;pertaining to health and wellness topics (&ldquo;Content&rdquo;), selected products and services related
				to wellness, and access to wellness professionals and facilities offering their services via the Service (the
				&ldquo;Practitioners&rdquo;). The Service contains certain pages, sections, services, and content that are only
				available to registered members of the Maven services, including a means to obtain video-chat or electronic
				messaging consultations for a range of medical issues by facilitating the connection between you and
				Practitioners through use of the Service. Your access to given elements of the Service may vary depending on
				one’s status as an Enterprise User, or for items and services that you choose to purchase via the Service. The
				Practitioners who deliver services through Maven&rsquo;s Service are independent professionals practicing within
				a group of independently owned professional practices. We do not practice medicine or any other licensed
				profession, and do not interfere with the practice of medicine or any other licensed profession by
				Practitioners, each of whom is responsible for his or her services and compliance with the requirements
				applicable to his or her profession and license. Neither Maven nor any third parties who promote the Services or
				provide you with a link to the Services shall be liable for any professional advice you obtain from a
				Practitioner via the Services.
			</p>

			<h5>SPECIAL SERVICES - MAVEN MILK</h5>

			<p>
				Maven also offers via the Service the <a href="https://www.mavenclinic.com/maven-milk">Maven Milk</a> service
				(“Maven Milk”), which facilitates the transport of breastmilk for nursing mothers traveling away from their
				babies. Maven Milk will be deemed part of the Service. Specific terms applicable to Maven Milk are available
				<a href="https://www.mavenclinic.com/maven-milk-terms">here</a> (the “Maven Milk Terms”). The Maven Milk Terms
				are hereby incorporated into these Terms of Use. If there is a conflict between these Maven Milk Terms and the
				Terms of Use, the Maven Milk Terms will control provided that, to avoid doubt, in all instances the Disclaimers,
				Limitation of Liability, and Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provisions in the Terms of Use will apply to
				Maven Milk.

			<h5>OUR RIGHT TO USE USER-PROVIDED CONTENT</h5>

			<p>
				We may, in our sole discretion, permit you to post or submit content and other materials through the Service
				(collectively, &ldquo;User-Provided Content&rdquo;). You grant us, and anyone authorized by us, a royalty-free,
				perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to use, copy, modify, transmit, sell,
				exploit, create derivative works from, distribute, and/or publicly perform or display such User-Provided
				Content, in whole or in part, in any manner or medium (whether now known or hereafter developed), for the

				judgment violates this Agreement or is otherwise unacceptable or inappropriate, whether for legal or other
				reasons.
			</p>

			<p>
				Any use by you of the User-Provided Content is entirely at your own risk. You represent and warrant that any
				User-Provided Content posted or transmitted by you is original to you and does not copy the work of any third
				party or otherwise infringe any third party intellectual property rights, rights of privacy or publicity rights
				and does not contain any defamatory or disparaging statements. Furthermore, you represent and warrant that you
				have the right to grant the license described above.

				provisions of this Section will control.
			</p>

			<h5>NOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT</h5>

			<p>
				Maven respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of copyrights and all other
				intellectual property very seriously, and Maven asks our users to do the same. Maven therefore employs measures
				to prevent copyright and other intellectual property infringement on the Service. Pursuant to Title 17, United
				States Code, Section 512(c)(2), if you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes
				copyright or other intellectual property infringement, please send a written notification of the claimed
				copyright or other intellectual property infringement to the following Designated Agent:
			</p>

			<p>
				Copyright Officer<br />
				Maven Clinic Co.<br />
				394 Broadway<br />
				Floor 3<br />
				New York, 10013<br />
				Phone: 570 302 4100<br />
				Email: support@mavenclinic.com
			</p>

			<p>
				Under Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(3)(A), to be effective the notification must include
				substantially the following information:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					A physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or
					other intellectual property interest that is allegedly infringed;
				</li>

				<li>
					Identification of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed, or if
					multiple copyrighted works or other intellectual property on the Service are covered by the notice, a
					representative list of such works;
				</li>

				<li>
					Identification of the material that you claim is infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and
					that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit
					Maven to locate the material;
				</li>

				<li>
					Information reasonably sufficient to permit Maven to contact you, such as your name, address, telephone number
					and email address;
				</li>

				<li>
					A statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright
					or other intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law; and
				</li>

				<li>
					A statement by you that the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright
					or other intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or other intellectual property
					owner&rsquo;s behalf.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Do not send any inquiries unrelated to copyright or other intellectual property infringements to the contact
				listed above.
			</p>

			<p>
				We reserve the right to promptly terminate without notice the accounts of users that are determined by us to be
				&ldquo;repeat infringers.&rdquo; A repeat infringer is a user who has been notified of infringing activity more
				than twice or has had User-Provided Content removed from the Service more than twice.

			<h5>ENTIRE AGREEMENT; GOVERNING LAW; VENUE; SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS</h5>

			<p>
				These Terms of Use and other policies Maven may post on the Service or that you and Maven may execute constitute
				the entire agreement between Maven and you in connection with your use of the Service and supersedes any prior
				agreements between Maven and you regarding use of the Service, including prior versions of these Terms of Use.
			</p>

			<p>
				This Service is controlled and operated by Maven from our offices within New York, United States of America.
				Those who choose to access the Service from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible
				for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent applicable. Access to the Service from jurisdictions where
				the contents of the Service are illegal or penalized is prohibited.
			</p>

			<p>
				By choosing to visit the Service, you agree that any dispute over your use of the Service or these Terms of Use
				will be governed by the laws of the State of New York and the United States of America, without regard to any
				conflicts of law provisions. You also consent to the adjudication of any disputes arising in connection with our
				Service in the state and federal courts located in New York, NY. You also agree to attempt to mediate any such
				dispute and to abide by all limitations of liability contained herein.
			</p>

			<p>
				All parts of these Terms of Use apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. We both agree that if we cannot
				enforce a part of this contract as written, then that part will be replaced with terms that most closely match
				the intent of the part we cannot enforce to the extent permitted by law. The invalidity of part of these Terms
				of Use will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. The section headings are for
				convenience and do not have any force or effect.
			</p>

			<h4>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</h4>

			<h5>GENERALLY</h5>

			<p>
				In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Maven in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and
				except as described in sub-section of this section titled &ldquo;Exception,&rdquo; you and Maven agree that
				every dispute arising in connection with these Terms of Use will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration
				is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may
				allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators
				can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all
				claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Use, whether based in contract, tort, statute,
				fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after
				the termination of these Terms of Use. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU
				AND MAVEN&nbsp;ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
			</p>

			<h5>EXCEPTIONS</h5>

			<p>
				Despite the provisions of the subsection of this section titled &ldquo;Generally,&rdquo; nothing in these Terms
				of Use will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an
				individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state,
				or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration;
				or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
			</p>

			<h5>ARBITRATOR</h5>

			<p>
				Any arbitration between you and Maven will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the
				American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively,
				&ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) as modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online
				at
				<a
					href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.adr.org/&sa=D&ust=1536333785564000"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
					>www.adr.org</a
				>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Maven. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to
				resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration
				agreement.
			</p>

			<h5>NOTICE OF ARBITRATION; PROCESS</h5>

			<p>
				A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by
				certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a
				current physical address, then by electronic mail (&ldquo;Notice of Arbitration&rdquo;). Maven&rsquo;s address
				for Notice is: Maven Clinic Co., 394 Broadway, 3rd floor, New York, NY 10013. The Notice of Arbitration must:
				(a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought
				(&ldquo;Demand&rdquo;). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the
				parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or
				Maven may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be
				confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any
				settlement offer made by you or Maven must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a
				final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement
				amount offered by Maven in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Maven will pay to you the higher of:
				(i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii)$10,000.
			</p>

			<h5>FEES</h5>

			<p>
				If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Use, Maven will reimburse you for your payment of
				the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be
				decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York,
				NY, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a)
				solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone
				hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your
				billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the
				Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule
				of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you
				agree to reimburse Maven for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay
				under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a
				reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and
				award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and
				reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made
				within 14 days of the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling on the merits.
			</p>

			<h5>NO CLASS ACTIONS</h5>

			<p>
				YOU AND MAVEN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT
				AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and
				Maven agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not
				otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
			</p>

			<h5>MODIFICATIONS TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION</h5>

			<p>
				If Maven makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Maven&rsquo;s address for
				Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to
				Maven&rsquo;s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Maven will be immediately
				terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will
				survive.
			</p>

			<h5>ENFORCEABILITY</h5>

			<p>
				If the Section titled &ldquo;No Class Actions&rdquo; is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this
				Section titled &ldquo;Dispute Resolution and Arbitration=&rdquo;&nbsp;is found to be unenforceable, then the
				entirety of this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Section will be null and void and, in that case, the parties
				agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in the section titled &ldquo;Governing Law; Venue;
				Severability of Provisions&rdquo; will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Use.
			</p>

			<h5>NO AGENCY RELATIONSHIP</h5>

			<p>
				Neither these Terms of Use, nor any Content, materials or features of the Service create any partnership, joint
				venture, employment, or other agency relationship between us and you. You may not enter into any contract on our
				behalf or bind us in any way.
			</p>

			<h5>ASSIGNMENT</h5>

			<p>
				You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms of Use, and any such attempt will be null and void.
				Maven may, in its discretion, transfer, without further consent or notification, all contractual rights and
				obligations pursuant to these Terms of Use if some or all of the business of Maven is transferred to another
				entity by way of merger, sale of its assets or otherwise.
