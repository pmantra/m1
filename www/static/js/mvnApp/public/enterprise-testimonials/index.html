					&ldquo;I just wanted to give a great big “thumbs-up” for making such important and vital information
					accessible for the people who need it. It is by far one of the best benefits within the Benefits package.
					Although I am way past the age of concern, I empathize with those who have fertility issues. Again, a great

				<p>
					&ldquo;I was first introduced to Maven through my work through the benefits program. I was about 10 weeks
					pregnant and I was freaking out. So, I was able to video chat with a nurse practitioner at a time that was
					convenient for me and it helped me put my mind at ease. It helped me make it to the next Tuesday when I was
					able to see my doctor. Then the follow up support I had after that was awesome. I truly felt like the team at
					Maven cared about my feelings and knew and understood all of the fears I had. I am so thankful for Maven and
					would strongly recommend it to anyone who is a first time mom.&rdquo;

			<h3>What doctors say</h3>
			<div class="testimonial">
				<p>
					&ldquo;With Maven’s maternity platform, patients can have extended conversations on Maven, not only with
					physicians, but with mid-level practitioners, lactation consultants, physical therapists and mental health
					providers. In this way, Maven fills in the edges of a patient care episode and provides the patient added
					time, mentoring and education.&rdquo;

			<div class="testimonial">
				<p>
					&ldquo;Maven Maternity is a complement to my practice. As any busy physician will tell you, there are a lot of
					anticipatory guidance conversations one would like to have with patients, but the confines of an in-person OB
					visit simply don’t allow for them.&rdquo;

			<div class="testimonial">
				<p>
					&ldquo;Many times parents just want to know whether or not their child needs to be seen by a provider in
					person - and how urgently. I like that moms and dads (particularly new moms and dads!) can use Maven to make
					that decision with a video appointment with other pediatricians or pediatric nurse practitioners, giving
					middle-of-the-night peace of mind or even just saving time that might have been spent waiting for a return
					phone call…&rdquo;
