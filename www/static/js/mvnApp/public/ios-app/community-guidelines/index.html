		<h3>Maven Community Guidelines</h3>

    <div class="row">
	    <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">

				<p>At Maven, we believe that an honest community of women and healthcare practitioners is a powerful antidote to online misinformation and confusion.</p>

				<p>Our conversations allow women to be anonymous because we believe it makes it easier to speak freely about private health questions&mdash;but we share the identity of our Maven Practitioners so you can get to know them and their backgrounds.</p>

				<p>Maven is not a pre-moderated forum, so we ask that everyone respect the following community guidelines:</p>

				<h5>YES:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Be open-minded and supportive</p></li>
					<li><p>Respect the thoughts and questions of the community</p></li>
					<li><p>Report bad behavior so we can take the appropriate actions</p></li>
					<li><p>Say whatever you want to make this an honest place where other members of the community feel comfortable sharing</p></li>
					<li><p>Try to use good grammar and spelling&mdash;it makes it easier for everyone to read</p></li>
				</ul>
				<h5>NO:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Don’t treat any of this as medical advice&mdash;and always call 911 for urgent medical issues</p></li>
					<li><p>Don’t post someone’s personal information</p></li>
					<li><p>Don’t post anything illegal</p></li>
					<li><p>Don’t harass, troll, or otherwise purposefully try and make someone else feel miserable</p></li>
					<li><p>Don’t post threats&mdash;we will delete them and reserve the right to flag to authorities if there is an issue</p></li>
					<li><p>Don’t post terrible things like racism or hate speech</p></li>
					<li><p>Don’t post anything that’s spammy, commercial, or would be considered advertising</p></li>
					<li><p>The Maven community is about supporting each other, and we won’t tolerate anyone that tries to stop our forum from being a welcoming place</p></li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				<p>Maven can terminate your access at any time for abusing these guidelines. Please remember that Maven's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy apply.</p>
