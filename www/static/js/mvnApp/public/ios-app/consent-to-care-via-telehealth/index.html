				<h3 id="coaching" style="text-decoration: underline;">Consent to Services via Coaching</h3>

				<p>
					I understand that the virtual appointment I have requested is not for medical services, such as
					medical assessment, diagnosis, or treatment. My intent in scheduling the virtual appointment is to
					obtain general information, education, coaching, guidance, and/or referrals and not to replace the
					care I am receiving from my medical providers.
				</p>

				<p>
					I agree to receive this virtual appointment with the professional whom I selected. I
					understand that the professional providing the identified services to me and utilizing the
					Maven platform through the Maven Site, as defined in the Maven Terms of Use, may be remotely located
					from my location.
				</p>

				<p>
					The scope of services will be at the sole discretion of the professional from whom I am
					receiving this service, but will be limited to general information, education, coaching, guidance,
					and/or referrals. I acknowledge and understand that any assessment, diagnosis, treatment, or
					prescription is excluded from the scope of services. The professional will determine
					whether or not the questions or concerns I have are appropriate for the limited scope of this
					encounter via the Site. I consent to receive such services and to speak to a non-Maven health care
					practitioner before taking any action in reliance on such services.
				</p>

				<p>
					I also agree and authorize my professional to release information regarding the
					consultation to Maven consistent with the Terms of Use set forth on the Site.
					<br />A virtual appointment means that my services are provided, as applicable (A) by a
					professional at a distant location using interactive video and/or audio conferencing in real time or
					(B) with the aid of exchanged digital images, by an asynchronous remote consultation.
				</p>

				<h4>I also understand that:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The services provided by the professional are educational in nature and that I should
						consult with my healthcare provider(s) if I need any medical services, including medical
						assessment, diagnosis, or treatment. I understand this may require travel and may need to be
						arranged urgently if an urgent need arises
					</li>
					<li>
						It is not the purpose of this service to create a patient/provider relationship.
					</li>
					<li>
						The same confidentiality and privacy protections that apply to my Maven’s services also apply to
						these services.
					</li>
					<li>
						I have access to all of my health and wellness information pertaining to the services in
						accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
					</li>
				</ul>


				<p>
					<strong>I have read this document carefully, and all my questions were answered to my satisfaction.
						I hereby consent to participate in the virtual appointment with my selected
						professional using the Site pursuant to the terms, conditions, standards, and requirements
						referenced at the Site. </strong>
				</p>

				<h3 id="telehealth" style="text-decoration: underline;">Consent to Services via Telehealth</h3>

				<p>
					I agree to receive this health care service provided by the health care practitioner(s) whom I
					selected. As a telehealth service, I understand that the health care practitioner(s), providing the
					identified services to me and utilizing the Maven telehealth platform through the Maven Site as
					defined in the Maven Terms of Use, is(are) located in location(s) remote from my location.
				</p>

				<p>
					The scope of care will be at the sole discretion of the health care practitioner(s) from whom I am
					receiving this service, with no guarantee of diagnosis, treatment, or prescription. The health care
					practitioner(s) will determine whether or not the condition being diagnosed and/or treated is
					appropriate for a telehealth encounter via the Site.
				</p>

				<p>
					I also agree and authorize my health care practitioner(s) to release information regarding the
					telehealth visit to Maven consistent with the Terms of Use set forth on the Site.
				</p>

				<p>
					A telehealth service means that my health care services are provided, as applicable (A) by
					practitioner(s) at a distant location using interactive video and/or audio conferencing in real time
					or (B) with the aid of exchanged digital images of my condition, by an asynchronous remote
					evaluation and consultation.
				</p>

				<h4>I also understand that:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I may have to travel to see a health care practitioner in–person for certain diagnosis and
						treatment matters.
					</li>
					<li>
						The same confidentiality and privacy protections that apply to my other health care services
						also apply to these telehealth services.
					</li>
					<li>
						I have access to all of my health and wellness information pertaining to the telehealth services
						in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
					</li>
					<li>
						I may need to see an appropriately trained health care professional in-person immediately after
						the telehealth service if an urgent need arises.
					</li>
					<li>
						My health care information may be shared with other individuals for treatment, payment and
						health care operations purposes.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					<strong>I have read this document carefully, and all my questions were answered to my satisfaction.
						I hereby consent to participate in the telehealth visit with my selected health care
						practitioner(s) using the Site pursuant to the terms, conditions, standards, and requirements
						referenced at the Site.
