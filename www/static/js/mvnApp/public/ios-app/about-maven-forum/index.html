				<h1>About Maven</h1>

				<p>
					Most people don’t know this: Women in America make 80% of all health decisions for themselves and their
					families. But the current healthcare system is not exactly female-friendly. This fact is all too obvious for
					any mother who has ever had to miss work to get care for her child, or any student struggling to get birth
					control, or any woman who has worried all night because she can’t get a simple answer from her doctor.
				</p>

				<p>
					We started Maven because we want to make it easier for women to get immediate, professional care, from someone
					they trust. Wherever they are, whenever they need it. We’ve built a network of doctors, nurse practitioners,
					mental health providers, and specialists in all areas of women’s and children’s health, and the Maven app
					makes it easy for women to connect with them directly via video appointment or private message—whether it’s
					for a prescription or just for peace of mind.
