					<h1>Google the weather, not your symptoms</h1>
					
					<h2>What are seasonal allergies?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Also known as hay fever or allergic rhinitis</li>
						<li>Sneezing, coughing, and itchy eyes/nose, only during certain times of the year</li>
						<li>Mimic common cold symptoms</li>
						<li>Commonly triggered by grass, pollen, and mold</li>
						<li>Your body’s reaction to a harmless environmental substance</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2>Symptoms of seasonal allergies</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Nasal congestion</li>
						<li>Sneezing</li>
						<li>Clear runny nose</li>
						<li>Itchy eyes and nose</li>
						<li>Sinus pressure</li>
						<li>Postnasal dripping</li>
						<li>Loss of smell and taste</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2>Treatments for seasonal allergies and how Maven can help</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Antihistamines. These over the counter medications can help reduce the effects of seasonal allergies by blocking the receptors of the allergy particles.</li>
						<li>Decongestants. While sometimes available over the counter, a Maven practitioner can prescribe stronger versions of these mediations which can reduce nasal congestion.</li>
						<li>Use a dehumidifier at home. Using a dehumidifier can reduce the effects of seasonal allergies. Speak with a Maven practitioner about changes you can make to your living environment to improve your allergy conditions.</li>
					</ul>
