				treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we learn that we have received any information from an
				individual under the age of 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to remove the data as permitted by
				law. If you believe an individual under 13 years of age has provided us with Personal Data without parental
				consent, please contact us at support@mavenclinic.com or by postal mail at the contact information listed in the

				<p><strong>9. LINKS TO OTHER SITES</strong></p>

				applicable law. We will also retain your Personal Data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations,
				resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We use the following criteria to set our retention periods: (i)
				the duration of our relationship with you; (ii) the purposes for processing your Personal Data and associated
				legal bases; (iii) the existence of a legal obligation as to the retention period; and (iv) the advisability of
