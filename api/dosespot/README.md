# Dosespot ðŸ’‰

[Dosespot](https://www.dosespot.com/) is a third party service which allows providers to write e-prescriptions for our members. 

Providers sign into Dosespot via Single Sign On, using their Maven identity and a pair of Dosespot keys which must be set manually for them via the admin portal. 

We send providers to the third party interface to write prescriptions, but also pull related notifications into our own interface via their api. 

We handle users picking their pharmacy via our own interface and Dosespot's api. Code calling the Dosespot api is in `api/utils/dosespot.py`.

```
Note: When testing the DoseSpot API on the staging site, only certain pharmacies will accept prescriptions without an error.
