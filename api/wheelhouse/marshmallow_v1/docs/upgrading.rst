Upgrading to Newer Releases
===========================

Upgrading to 1.2
++++++++++++++++

.. module:: marshmallow.fields

Validators
**********

Validators were rewritten as class-based callables, making them easier to use when declaring fields.

.. code-block:: python

    from marshmallow import fields

    # 1.2
    from marshmallow.validate import Range

    age = fields.Int(validate=[Range(min=0, max=999)])

    # Pre-1.2
    from marshmallow.validate import ranging

    age = fields.Int(validate=[lambda val: ranging(val, min=0, max=999)])


The validator functions from 1.1 are deprecated and will be removed in 2.0.

Deserializing the Empty String
******************************


In version 1.2, deserialization of the empty string (``''``) with `DateTime`, `Date`, `Time`, or `TimeDelta` fields results in consistent error messages, regardless of whether or not `python-dateutil` is installed.

.. code-block:: python

    from marshmallow import fields

    fields.Date().deserialize('')
    # UnmarshallingError: Could not deserialize '' to a date object.


Decimal
*******

The `Decimal` field was added to support serialization/deserialization of `decimal.Decimal` numbers. You should use this field when dealing with numbers where precision is critical. The `Fixed`, `Price`, and `Arbitrary` fields are deprecated in favor the `Decimal` field.


Upgrading to 1.0
++++++++++++++++

.. module:: marshmallow

Version 1.0 marks the first major release of marshmallow. Many big changes were made from the pre-1.0 releases in order to provide a cleaner API, support object deserialization, and improve field validation.

Perhaps the largest change is in how objects get serialized. Serialization occurs by invoking the :meth:`Schema.dump` method rather than passing the object to the constructor.  Because only configuration options (e.g. the ``many``, ``strict``, and ``only`` parameters) are passed to the constructor, you can more easily reuse serializer instances.  The :meth:`dump <Schema.dump>` method also forms a nice symmetry with the :meth:`Schema.load` method, which is used for deserialization.

.. code-block:: python

    from marshmallow import Schema, fields

    class UserSchema(Schema):
        email = fields.Email()
        name = fields.String()

    user= User(email='monty@python.org', name='Monty Python')

    # 1.0
    serializer = UserSchema()
    data, errors = serializer.dump(user)
    # OR
    result = serializer.dump(user)
    result.data  # => serialized result
    result.errors  # => errors

    # Pre-1.0
    serialized = UserSchema(user)
    data = serialized.data
    errors = serialized.errors

.. note::

    Some crucial parts of the pre-1.0 API have been retained to ease the transition. You can still pass an object to a `Schema` constructor and access the `Schema.data` and `Schema.errors` properties. The `is_valid` method, however, has been completely removed. It is recommended that you migrate to the new API to prevent future releases from breaking your code.

.. module:: marshmallow.fields

The Fields interface was also reworked in 1.0 to make it easier to define custom fields with their own serialization and deserialization behavior. Custom fields now implement :meth:`Field._serialize` and :meth:`Field._deserialize`.

.. code-block:: python

    from marshmallow import fields, MarshallingError

    class PasswordField(fields.Field):
        def _serialize(self, value, attr, obj):
            if not value or len(value) < 6:
                raise MarshallingError('Password must be greater than 6 characters.')
            return str(value).strip()

        # Similarly, you can override the _deserialize method

Another major change in 1.0 is that multiple validation errors can be stored for a single field. The ``errors`` dictionary returned by :meth:`Schema.dump` and :meth:`Schema.load` is a list of error messages keyed by field name.


.. code-block:: python

    from marshmallow import Schema, fields, ValidationError

    def must_have_number(val):
        if not any(ch.isdigit() for ch in val):
            raise ValidationError('Value must have an number.')

    def validate_length(val):
        if len(val) < 8:
            raise ValidationError('Value must have 8 or more characters.')

    class ValidatingSchema(Schema):
        password = fields.String(validate=[must_have_number, validate_length])

    result, errors = ValidatingSchema().load({'password': 'secure'})
    print(errors)
    # {'password': ['Value must have an number.',
    #               'Value must have 8 or more characters.']}

Other notable changes:

- Serialized output is no longer an `OrderedDict` by default. You must explicitly set the `ordered` class Meta option to `True` .
- :class:`Serializer` has been renamed to :class:`Schema`, but you can still import `marshmallow.Serializer` (which is aliased to :class:`Schema`).
- ``datetime`` objects serialize to ISO8601-formatted strings by default (instead of RFC821 format).
- The ``fields.validated`` decorator was removed, as it is no longer necessary given the new Fields interface.
- `Schema.factory` class method was removed.
