## Contentful Schema Management
These scripts and directory structure are  copied almost exactly from `dashboard-api`. 
Maybe one day there will be a better way to share these kinds of things across repos.
For now, know that if you make changes to these scripts or process, it would probably make sense to bring them into
`dashboard-api` too. 

The corresponding directory in `dashboard-api` is `/contentful_schema`. The gitlab link is [here](https://gitlab.mvnapp.net/maven/dashboard-api/-/tree/master/contentful_schema).
