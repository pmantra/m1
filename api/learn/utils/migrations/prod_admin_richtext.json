Test the water to make sure it's not too hot—it should be just a little bit warmer than lukewarm. Two big don’ts to keep in mind: Don't keep the water running while your baby is in the tub, and never leave your child alone in the bath, not even for a second.

The problem is, if you have barely any contact with a medical provider, how will you know what’s a real problem and what needs treatment? The proposed ACOG guidelines advocate for more comprehensive care beginning as early as three days after childbirth, and lasting as long as three months, when a full assessment would take place to make sure your physical, social, and psychological well-being is in a healthy place.

While some experts are studying whether they are as dangerous as we once thought, for now the American Heart Association says saturated fats shouldn’t take up too much space in your diet. So if trans and saturated fats are mostly out, what’s left? Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. Polyunsaturated fats—good sources include fatty fish such as salmon and and sardines, as well as flaxseeds and walnuts—can help lower your bad (LDL) cholesterol levels.

And if you need some extra guidance or don’t have anyone you feel you can trust, the career coaches on Maven’s platform are pros in this area, and can help you navigate the tricky terrain of balancing your career with the demands of pregnancy and parenthood.

Make them a co-owner. “Let them take over completely,” Ferrante advises. “If you agree that they’ll do the grocery shopping and they forget the milk, they have to be the one to run out and buy it.

Reflect on what would make your life easier—whether it’s having someone deep-clean your home once a month so you only have to do light cleaning the rest of the time, or paying the nanny to stay late some evenings or help around the house. Ferrante notes that “a lot of people also have nannies do laundry or light meal prep. Some care providers do it naturally, but not all do, so don’t make assumptions. When you work out your contract with your nanny, the tendency is to focus only on the child. But if your time is worth more than what you’re paying the nanny, it makes sense to pay extra to take some things off your plate.” And the next time you’re tempted to splurge on a nice pair of shoes, ask yourself if you’d be happier spending that money on a babysitter so you can enjoy a night off.","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"heading-2","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"5.

You have your own doctor’s appointments and errands to run, and you crave adult conversations,” says Daly-Padron. “I work from home, and I’m long overdue for a mammogram because I have no time for it!

She recalls her own decision to become a career coach after having her daughters: “I was at the same company for 17 years.

If you can, find a mentor at work to help you visualize what your future at the company might look like: “Talk to someone who’s ahead of you and understand what their role is.

But I underestimated how much I’d miss having colleagues—someone to ask a quick question or chat with. I have to find ways to bring that to myself now.

When she first became a career coach, she gave herself two years to see if she could make it work: “By the end of that timeframe, I told myself I had to be bringing in some revenue for my family. And if I can’t meet that, I’ll change again. I had worked in one place for 17 years before breaking out on my own.

Obesity can affect egg quality and may make it harder to have success with IVF. And the actual egg retrieval process can also be more of a challenge for overweight and obese women. (The ovaries have a tendency to move higher up the body because of excess fatty tissue in the pelvis, which means it’s harder to use a needle to get the eggs out.)

For instance, “obesity increases the risk of congenital anomalies (birth defects) such as cardiac defects (heart defects) and spina bifida, blood clots (deep venous thrombosis), the need for Cesarean section, and the odds of postpartum wound infection,” notes Jackie Stone, M.D., a Maven OB-GYN.

In an IVF cycle, the dose of gonadotropins that a patient takes is much higher.

A small experimental study led by Belgium researchers used VR—one simulation was a virtual underwater walk cut off from all ambient sound—on 100 women going through IVF. Promisingly, the participants reported a significant decrease in their anxiety after the session. While you probably won’t find this technique at a clinic near you quite yet (and let’s face it, many people will simply find the idea too wacky), the takeaway here is that seeking out healthy ways to escape your day-to-day may be very useful when you’re going through treatment. Getting lost in a movie, a good book, or a podcast may be just the “VR” you need to redirect your attention.","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{}}]}},"relatedReads":{"en-US":["the-new-facts-about-acupuncture-for-fertility","infertility-mood-can-diet-make-a-difference-if-im-feeling-depressed","how-to-heal-the-relationship-with-your-body-during-infertility-treatment"]}},"embedded_entries":{"embedded_images":[],"callouts":[],"accordions":[]}},"807":{"content_type_id":"article","fields":{"title":{"en-US":"How far would you drive for a fertility clinic?"},"heroImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"ec5f43e4116d53912b7375f0f4cd8a8e"}}},"slug":{"en-US":"how-far-would-you-drive-for-a-fertility-clinic"},"medicallyReviewed":{"en-US":false},"richText":{"en-US":{"nodeType":"document","data":{},"content":[{"nodeType":"paragraph","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"One hour?

Eggs are tricky to freeze because they’re water-filled cells, and the previous method of slow-cooling made it possible for ice crystals to form. This would frequently damage the cells and rupture them, says Dr. Najmabadi. With vitrification, however, eggs are first treated with high concentrations of cryoprotectants (aka anti-icing chemicals), then rapidly chilled by being plunged into liquid nitrogen. The result is that they’re much less vulnerable to damage.

Dr. Kort says that market dynamics play a big role, so where you live could dictate how steep your annual storage bill is. New York City, for instance, is one of the priciest cities to store your eggs, with a price-tag of $1,100 per year, on average. If you live in San Francisco, on the other hand, an annual storage fee could be less than half of that amount. “It’s strange that there is such variation,” says Dr. Kort. “I think part of it is just the competitive landscape in places like San Francisco.” After all, while egg freezing is on the rise everywhere, Silicon Valley has been thought of as a “hub” for the growing trend.

In the U.S., there is no such law. Both Dr. Kort and Dr. Najmabadi say that eggs do not change over time. “When you thaw an egg that was frozen using vitrification, that egg doesn’t know whether it’s been frozen a second, or a year, or ten years,” says Dr. Najmabadi. One caveat: Because the technology is so new, there isn’t a lot of data. But we do know that healthy babies have been born from eggs that have been frozen longer than 10 years.

When using eggs that have been previously frozen, Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) is the recommended form of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). With this method, sperm gets injected directly into the egg—making it easier to penetrate the egg’s membrane that tends to harden during freezing. If fertilization occurs, a fertilized egg will develop into an embryo, which will be allowed to grow for about 5 days (at this point it’s called a blastocyst) in a lab before it’s transferred to your uterus—the first step in a successful pregnancy.

In one study of 1,500 women who froze their eggs at age 35 or younger, the chance of live birth increased from 15% for women who froze just 5 eggs, to 61% for women who froze 10 eggs, and 85% for women who froze 15 or more eggs.","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"heading-2","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"2.

One study of more than 1,400 women in Spain, for example, has already led to some helpful conclusions: “We saw a marked dip in live birth rates among women using eggs frozen when they were 36 or older compared to younger women—23% versus 50%,” notes Dr. Morin. “It’s the best data we have right now for patients to figure out, okay, if I freeze this many eggs when I’m this age, this is my chance of actually getting pregnant using those eggs.” But as egg freezing becomes more common, and as more women use their eggs to become pregnant, we’ll have more—and bigger—studies to draw from.","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"heading-2","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"3.

For instance, researchers are testing a long-acting form of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could be given as just one weekly shot instead of the daily dose women typically self-inject when undergoing egg freezing. Other alternatives to ovarian hyperstimulation could also become more mainstream in the future. One procedure that already exists is In Vitro Maturation (IVM) (IVM), where eggs are collected from a woman before they are matured, meaning the retrieval can occur with little to no hormonal injections.

So far, screening methods have relied on removing a few cells from an embryo so they can be biopsied—a procedure that is generally safe but, according to Dr. Najmabadi, can harm 3-5% of embryos.
