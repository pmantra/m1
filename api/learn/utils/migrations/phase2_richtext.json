With this in mind, you may want to consider selecting a low-deductible health plan even if it looks more expensive on the benefits selection sheet. Here’s why: With a low-deductible plan, you’ll likely pay more for your premium (the up-front amount you pay each month), but your coverage will kick in sooner, and you’ll only be responsible for copays and a small percentage of the total costs (your coinsurance). If you have a high deductible plan, you’ll likely end up paying more in the long run, because you’ll responsible for paying more medical costs in full before your coverage kicks in.

REPLACEWITHLINEBREAKREPLACEWITHLINEBREAKPreimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) may also be an option if you choose to go with a frozen embryo transfer. “PGT-A is a genetic screening that can determine which embryos have a normal chromosome number and thus the highest chance of success per transfer,” Goldstein says. “If you choose to do PGT-A, you actually won’t have your fresh embryos transferred right away. Instead, the embryos will be frozen and you’ll come back later to do a frozen embryo transfer.” You and your doctor should have a detailed conversation about fresh untested embryo transfer vs frozen embryo transfer with PGT-A, and which is the best option for your particular case. In terms of timeline, PGT-A adds just a few weeks to the process. “The embryos are biopsied and frozen 5-6 days after retrieval, and you’ll recover from the egg retrieval with no more treatment,” Goldstein says. “The biopsies are sent off for genetic testing which usually takes 7-10 days and the results usually come back right around the time you get a period (2 weeks after retrieval) so you can start a frozen embryo transfer cycle (which is roughly three weeks from start to transfer).” REPLACEWITHLINEBREAKREPLACEWITHLINEBREAKFor the fresh or the frozen transfer, your doctor will deposit the embryo using a thin catheter inserted into the vagina, through the cervix and into the uterus.
